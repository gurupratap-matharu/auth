# Authorization

Authorization is the process to check if a user is *authorized* to do a specific
task in our system.
For ex:

- is a user authorized to view the content
- is a user authorized to update the content
- is a user authorized to delete the content
- is a user authorized to access the content

Here updating, accessing, deleting or viewing are basically permissions
So in a way we are checking if a user has permission
